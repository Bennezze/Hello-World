# Hello-World
I am creating this repo as per instruction from help in GitHub
As per instructions I write a little about myself:
mid-life male learning about GitHub because I bought a Smartthings Hub. This Hub does not support Nest thermostat and I want it too. Update jul 2018: got all sorts of things working on my Smarthing hub today I am updating the nest manager app.
